Homework #1 Explainations

Problem #1) 
   part a.

CG-USER(3): (+ (- 5 1) (+ 3 7))
14

Explaination: 
	The list terms (- 5 1) and (+ 3 7) are evaluated then summed to give the Final value 14

   part b.

CG-USER(4): (list 1 (+ 2 3))
(1 5)

Explaination: 
	The command lists the two atoms "1 5" wiere 5 is evaluated from the list item 2+3

   c)

CG-USER(5): (if (listp 1) (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))
7

Explaination:
	The condition returns NIL so the code will evaluate the second term which returns the integer 7

   d)

CG-USER(14): (list (and (listp 3) t) (+ 1 2))
(NIL 3)

Explaination:
	The code will list two atoms, the first is the return value of the condition (and (listp 3) t) which will return NIL because the atom 3 is not a list. The second atom is the evaluation of (+ 1 2) which returns 3.


Problem #2)

	Give 3 different Cons expressions which give (A B C)
1.

CG-USER(22): (cons 'a '(b c))
(A B C)

2.

CG-USER(2): (cons 'a (cons 'b '(c)))
(A B C)

3.

CG-USER(4): (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c nil)))
(A B C)

Problem #3)

	Using car and cdr, define a function to return the forth element of a list

Code:
(defun my-fourth (lst)
  (if (null lst)
    nil 
    (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
    
    (car (cdr (cdr (cdr lst))))

Explaination:
	This code is essentially a function named my-fourth that takes the input
Problem #4)
Problem #5)
Problem #6)
Problem #7)
Problem #8)
Problem #9)
