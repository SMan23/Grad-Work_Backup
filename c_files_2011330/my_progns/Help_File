    Printing to Standard Output

    The following example gets the current time, converts it to a string using localtime() and asctime(), and prints it to standard output using fputs(). It then prints the number of minutes to an event for which it is waiting.

    #include <time.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    ...
    time_t now;
    int minutes_to_event;
    ...
    time(&now);
    printf("The time is ");
    fputs(asctime(localtime(&now)), stdout);
    printf("There are still %d minutes to the event.\n",
        minutes_to_event);
    ...
