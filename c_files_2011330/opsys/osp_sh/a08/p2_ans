 christopher.capurso:  So, any idea how to switch the way the sort command works? Sort from right to left of each line rather than from left to right?

 me:  ehy chris
im not sure about that sort
but when ever i try to do a loop
using say n="$#"
as the number to decrement
it keeps treating it like a file
 christopher.capurso:  I think you need two loops
 me:  and saying "2: no file or directory found"
 christopher.capurso:  So pipe the output of find into a loop
Then use echo `basename ... `  `dirname ... `
Then pipe that into a sort
 me:  ahhh
echo
yessir
 christopher.capurso:  That way, you will have a sorted list with the filename first then the directory name
Then pipe that into another loop in order to find duplicates
I think that will work
 me:  ic you spent some serious time on this
